# Breast_Cancer_Survival_Prediction
My project focuses on breast cancer survival prediction using machine learning, where the goal is to predict the likelihood of survival for breast cancer patients based on clinical and demographic data. For this project, I worked with a dataset containing various attributes like age, tumor size, lymph node status, and treatment type. After preprocessing the data, I experimented with several algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests,Naive baye's,K-nearest neighbor, to determine which model best predicts survival outcomes. I evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure a reliable and well-balanced prediction.
